# event-management
We created a event management system using JAVA and MYSQL as database. 
Firstly, import through build path 4 jar files as preferred libraries.
Then you need to import all the uploaded database dump files into your MYSQL .
Save your databse table as- "event_managment"
Then in login package in DBConnect class you have to enter your MYSQL id and password.
Then to show email you have to enter sender gmail address and password. 
And we have used google server for email .
In sender gmail he has to update two settings- Two step verification should be turned off and Allow Less Secure App should be turned on.
